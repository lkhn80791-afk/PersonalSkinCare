## PersonalSkin API Specification (Initial Draft)

This document will describe REST endpoints for:

- Authentication (signup, login, token refresh)
- User profiles and skin profiles
- Product catalog queries
- Routine generation and tracking
- Community posts and comments

> TODO: Flesh out detailed request/response schemas once the modules are implemented.
